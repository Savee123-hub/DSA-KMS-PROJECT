# DSA-KMS-PROJECT
This is where I started my portfolio building when taking a data analysis class on incubator hub

## PROJECT TPOIC: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This repository presents a detailed analysis of KMS's sales, customers, and shipping performance using real business data. The project is divided into three main sections: Sales Analysis, Customer Analysis, and Shipping Analysis. Each section answers specific business questions to support data-driven decisions that can help KMS improve profitability, reduce operational inefficiencies, and better serve its customers.
